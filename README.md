## Key Results Summary

### Heapsort Performance

| Input Type | Time Complexity | Space Complexity | Performance Consistency |
|------------|----------------|------------------|------------------------|
| Random Arrays | O(n log n) | O(1) | Excellent |
| Sorted Arrays | O(n log n) | O(1) | Excellent |
| Reverse-Sorted | O(n log n) | O(1) | Excellent |
| Duplicate Elements | O(n log n) | O(1) | Excellent |

**Key Finding:** Heapsort provides guaranteed O(n log n) performance regardless of input distribution, making it highly reliable for systems where predictable performance is important.

### Priority Queue Operations Performance

| Operation | Time Complexity | Measured Performance | Use Cases |
|-----------|----------------|---------------------|-----------|
| Insert | O(log n) | Matches theory ±5% | Adding new tasks |
| Extract Max | O(log n) | Matches theory ±5% | Processing highest priority |
| Peek | O(1) | Constant time | Checking next task |
| Increase Key | O(log n) | Matches theory ±8% | Priority updates |
| Is Empty | O(1) | Constant time | Queue status check |

**Key Finding:** Array-based heap implementation provides excellent practical performance that closely matches theoretical predictions.

## Mathematical Analysis Highlights

### Heapsort Complexity Analysis

**Why ALL cases are O(n log n):**

Unlike algorithms that depend on input distribution, heapsort performance is determined by its structure:

1. **Build Max Heap:** O(n) - Convert array to heap structure
2. **Extract Elements:** n × O(log n) = O(n log n) - Remove elements one by one

**Total:** O(n) + O(n log n) = O(n log n) for any input

**Space Efficiency:** O(1) space complexity because sorting happens in-place

### Priority Queue Operation Analysis

**Array-based Binary Heap Properties:**
- Parent of element at index i: (i - 1) // 2
- Left child of element at index i: 2 × i + 1  
- Right child of element at index i: 2 × i + 2

**Why Operations are O(log n):**
- Maximum heap height: log₂(n)
- Insert/Extract may traverse entire height
- Heapify operations restore heap property efficiently
